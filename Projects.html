<p style="text-align: center;">I have currently built many projects during my stay at UCF</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My current philoshophy towards making projects is that if something interest or sparks at me or seems like I good idea I will think about it</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After some thoughts I begin looking for resources and how complex would it be to make and if it is similar or slightly above my skill level</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If what I understand to initially build the project seems great and fun at an initial point, I will write it in my notebook</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I have developed this way of thinking due to the nature of me being able to put better things onto the screen if I have an actual idea instead of just some random thought</p>



<h1 style="text-align: center;">CURRENTLY WORKING ON: xG Simulator</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">My latest project is an xG simulator for soccer in C++</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This new stat in soccer was introduced a few years back and it basically tries to predict the probability of a regular player scoring a shot</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, this is often based on historical data from what I have understood, without taking into account the physics and how the angles work</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I wanted to predict how are these shots calculated and if my hypothesis is correct and how close am I to those models</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">At some point I will implement a way to make that map available like where is a player shooting from and what did it result on</p>


<h1 style="text-align: center;">LILA!</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Unfortunately, some files were not backed and caused me to lose this game made in Unity and learned the importance of Git and Github with that</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To some relief, I have some video and pictures alongside the project design in my notebook</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This was a project developed by myself around February and April to celebrate my first anniversary with my girlfriend, a video game enthusiactic, I thought this was the best gift</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was a 3d platformer based around her with some challenges and reflected some gifts I gave her around the months alongside with notes that reflected what this game meant to me being able to give it to her</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Using assets from the Unity Store for free, I created a working platformer with some levels, I learned a lot of game development here which was one of the main goals</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Inspired in Halloween, this is a 2d platformer made in the Unity Engine</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This the project that inspired me to carry out a notebook or some type of notes to use, without having a clear philoshophy I just snowballed it until the end</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This was a project made for my mentee program in the Game Dev Knights Club where I needed to complete a game in the month</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This game was made also in the Unity platform alongside 4 other team members during the DnD's Game Jam in September 2024</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This was the first project of many including myself and we decided to do some ambitious platformer</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, we had to scale the game down a notch to get to the 48 hour deadline</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I developed the main movement of the player and others in the group did art or the level design alongside some code too</p>
